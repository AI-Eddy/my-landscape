              The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) initiative is an Industry
              Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI. The purpose of the ISG is
              to create a standardized, open environment which allows efficient
              and seamless integration of applications from vendors, service
              providers, and third parties across multi-vendor MEC platforms.

              The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) unites seven
              telecommunications standard development organizations (ARIB, ATIS,
              CCSA, ETSI, TSDSI, TTA, TTC), known as Organizational Partners.
              3GPP specifications cover cellular telecommunications technologies,
              including radio access, core network, and service capabilities, 
              providing a complete system description and interworking hooks
              for non-3GPP access networks.
