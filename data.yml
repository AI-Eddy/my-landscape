              The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) initiative is an Industry
              Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI. The purpose of the ISG is
              to create a standardized, open environment which allows efficient
              and seamless integration of applications from vendors, service
              providers, and third parties across multi-vendor MEC platforms.
